## Description

The goal of this project was to build a film search engine that seeks to improve user experience. By utilizing multiple server-side APIs, our application provides instant access to all necessary information about consumerâ€™s favorite movies in a single search. With just the click of a few buttons, users have access to plot summaries, movie ratings, and available streaming services for the movie of their choice!


## Finished Project

### Comments

* When the website loads, the user is greeted with a hero banner including the name of site as well as a search bar to begin their movie search.
* When the user searches for a movie, they recieve a variety of movie options matching the parameters of their search.
* Once the user clicks one of the search result options, they will be able to see detail about the movie, an image of the movie, ratings for the movie as well as links to those review sites, and finally websites where the movie is available to stream, as well as link to those sites.
* There is also a Your Movies page that will pull from local storage any movie that the user has recently viewed.
* The website is responsive and is compatible with any size screen.
